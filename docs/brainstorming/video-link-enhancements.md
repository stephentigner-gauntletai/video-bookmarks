Enhancements:

1. When clicking on an item in the list, it currently opens the video in a new tab.
However, it opens the video at the beginning.
* The link should include the timestamp of the last viewed position, so that the video opens at that position.
* If the user holds down shift, it should open at the furthest viewed position instead.
* This should be called out with help text above the list of bookmarks.
* Something like "Click to open in new tab at the last viewed position. Hold shift and click to open at the furthest viewed position."
